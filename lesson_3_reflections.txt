When would you want to use a remote repository 
rather than keeping all your work local?

1. When collaborating with colleagues who are 
different networks.
2. When working on 2 different PCs (eg. home
and work).
3. When sharing with public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote 
repository?

This allows you to keep the local repository in the state
you want to. May be in the middle of developing a feature when 
someone else updates.
